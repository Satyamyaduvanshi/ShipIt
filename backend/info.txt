### How to Test It (using `curl` or Postman)

Since these are `POST` requests, you can't test them just by putting the URL in your browser. You need to send data.

**1. Test Registration:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "testuser", "email": "test@example.com", "password": "mypassword"}'
```

**2. Test Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "mypassword"}'
